Here's a `README.md` template that provides API documentation for frontend developers who want to integrate your Flask-based category and resource management backend:

---

# üìö KnowledgeBase API

A RESTful API built with Flask for managing categorized learning resources. Frontend developers can use this API to create and retrieve categories and associated resources. JWT authentication is required for all protected endpoints.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Base URL

```
http://<your-domain>/api
```

Make sure to include the `Authorization: Bearer <JWT>` header for all secured endpoints.

---

## üîê Authentication

**Login and registration routes are handled separately.** Ensure your frontend obtains a JWT token for the user, which is required to access the endpoints listed below.
